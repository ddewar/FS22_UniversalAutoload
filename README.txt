  UNIVERSAL AUTOLOAD (Loki_79)
==============================================================

  This specialisation is globally applied to all configured pallets and trailers.  There is no separate version of each vehicle to buy from the shop, and there is no configuration to select, it will just work on the supported vehicles.
  
  If you already own a configured vehicle in your save game, then the autoloading specialisation will be applied with the mod, i.e. there is no need to sell and buy each vehicle again.  It can also be removed form all vechicles by simply removing the mod, your trailer will not disappear.

  Base game supported trailers are defined in the file "SupportedVehicles.xml".  For some trailers only certain configurations are supported, such as the bale trailer configuration (see list below).  It is a requirement that the configuration includes the "tension belts" specialisation.
  
  SUPPORTED TRAILERS:
   · Brantner DD 24073/2 XXL (bale trailer)
   · Bremer Transportwagen TP 500 S
   · BÖCKMANN MH-AL 4320/35

   · Farmtech DPW 1800 (standard)
   · Fliegl DTS 5.9
   · KRONE Trailer Profi Liner
   · Kröger PWO 24 (standard)
   · LODE KING Renown Drop Deck
   · Welger DK 115 (bale trailer)

  SUPPORTED VEHCILES:
   · Lizard Pickup 1986
   · Lizard Pickup 2017
   · Mahindra Retriever
   · JohnDeer XUV865M

==============================================================
  PALLETS/CONTAINERS:
==============================================================

  All base game pallets and containers (bigbags, IBCs, etc) are supported for autoloading.  This includes production pallets and any that can be purchased from the shop.  The method for identifying a pallet is to map the i3d file name to a predefined size.  The sizes for base game pallets are defined in the file "ContainerTypes.xml".  **Please NOTE that currently only square bales are supported** - I plan to include support for round bales and a work mode for collecting bales in a future release.
  
  MOD PALLETS:
  (A) If a mod pallet uses a base game i3d file, e.g. "bakeryBoxPallet.i3d", and the size has not been changed, then your mod pallet should work without any additional configuration.  If the size has changed, then you need to rename the i3d file (and see B).
  
  (B) If a mod file has a unique i3d file name, then the dimensions will be obtained from the object xml file.  Please make sure that the sizes listed are accurate and equal to (or slightly larger than) the collision box for your pallet model.  If any dimension given is too small (or much too large), then the pallets will not pack efficiently.

	<vehicle>
		<base>
			<typeDesc>$l10n_typeDesc_pallet</typeDesc>
			<filename>Vehicles/PotatoBoxes/PotatoBox.i3d</filename>
			<size width="1.850" length="1.200" height="1.100" />  <!-- DIMENSIONS OBTAINED FROM HERE -->
			<canBeReset>false</canBeReset>
			...
		</base>
	</vehicle>


==============================================================
  VEHICLES/TRAILERS:
==============================================================
  There is a hard coded list of supported base game trailers, but the specialisation will also be applied to any correctly configured mod trailers.  There is no need to add any shapes or objects to your model.  All that is required is some additions to the vehcile xml.
  
  Add configurations to the UniversalAutoload.xml file in the modSettings folder (Created on first map load with the mod installed) to add your own trailer loading areas:
  <universalAutoLoad>
    <vehicleConfigurations>
      <!--Base Game Item Example-->
      <vehicleConfiguration configFileName="data/vehicles/welger/dk115/dk115.xml" selectedConfigs="2">
          <loadingArea offset="0 1.339 -0.165" width="1.95" height="2.00" length="4.525"/>
      </vehicleConfiguration>
      <!--Mod Example-->
      <vehicleConfiguration configFileName="lizardgooseneck.xml" modName="FS22_20ftGooseneck" version="1.0.0.0">
          <loadingArea offset="0.000 1.100 -0.300" width="3.00" height="2.20" length="7.50"/>
          <options enableRearLoading="true" enableSideLoading="true"/>
      </vehicleConfiguration>
    </vehicleConfigurations>
  </universalAutoLoad>

  Add the following to your xml to use the specialisation in your mod trailer:
  	<vehicle>
		<universalAutoLoad>
			<vehicleConfigurations>
				<vehicleConfiguration>
					<loadingArea offset="0.000 1.050 -1.055" width="2.40" height="2.20" length="4.50"/>
				</vehicleConfiguration>
			</vehicleConfigurations>
		</universalAutoLoad>
	</vehicle>
	
  A more complicated version with different options for different configurations:
	<vehicle>
		<universalAutoLoad>
			<vehicleConfigurations>
				<vehicleConfiguration selectedConfigs="1">
					<loadingArea offset="0.000 1.050 -1.055" width="2.40" height="2.20" length="4.50"/>
					<options noLoadingIfUnfolded="true" isCurtainTrailer="false" enableRearLoading="false" showDebug="false"/>
				</vehicleConfiguration>
				<vehicleConfiguration selectedConfigs="2,3,4">
					<loadingArea offset="0.000 1.050 -1.055" width="2.40" height="2.20" length="4.50"/>
					<options noLoadingIfUnfolded="false" isCurtainTrailer="false" enableRearLoading="false" showDebug="false"/>
				</vehicleConfiguration>
			</vehicleConfigurations>
		</universalAutoLoad>
	</vehicle>


  CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
    [selectedConfigs] - The index (or comma separated indexes) for configurations autoloading will be applied to.  Use the index corresponding to the order in which the configurations were defined.  If this parameter is not provided, autoloading will be applied to all configurations.

  OPTIONS:
    [noLoadingIfFolded] - If true this parameter will prevent loading when the trailer is folded.  It will also prevent loading while it is folding or unfolding.  Use this if the loading area is only vaild for the unfolded state.
	
    [noLoadingIfUnfolded] - If true this parameter will prevent loading when the trailer is unfolded.  It will also prevent loading while it is folding or unfolding.  Use this if your unfolded trailer is not level or if the folding animation somehow blocks the loading area.

    [isCurtainTrailer] - This is an option specifically designed for the KRONE Profi Liner curtain trailer.  If true the autoloading script will detect the correct load side when open IF the tipSide.animation.name contains the string "Left" or "Right". Where:
	tipSide = self.spec_trailer.tipSides[self.spec_trailer.currentTipSideIndex] and self.spec_trailer.tipState == 2

    [enableRearLoading] - This is also designed for the KRONE Profi Liner curtain trailer, but can be applied to any trailer where automatic loading is required.  A pallet trigger is created at the rear of the trailer, and will load any valid objects detected here that are dynamically mounted to another vehcile (e.g. a forklift).

    [showDebug] - This option will enable a graphical debugging display for the specific trailer.  It shows the loading triggers, unloading triggers, player trigger, rear loading trigger (if enabled) and detected pallet dimensions.  The detected pallets are also colour coded depending if they are valid for loading/unloading.
  
  LOADING AREA:
	The loading area must be defined slightly smaller than the available volume.  Pallets should fit inside this defined volume without clipping any part of the model.
	
	width  - The width (X dimension) of the loading area
	height - The height (Y dimension) of the loading area
    length - The length (Z dimension) of the loading area
	offset - The offset to the defined loading area from the vehicle root node

   TIP: To measure the loading area parameters in the GIANTS Editor
   · Create a unit cube and set "Translate Y" = 0.5
   · "Freeze Transformations" with default options (reference node should move to centre of lower face)
   · Use "Interactive Placement" to set the height
        - Ctrl+B with the box selected
        - Left-click on the bed of the trailer
        - Manually set both X and Z coordinates back to zero
   · Adjust Scale (X,Y,Z) and Translate Z (if required) to position and scale the loading area
   · Copy those values into the vehicle xml using the format:
    <loadingArea offset="offsetX offsetY offsetZ" width="scaleX" height="scaleY" length="scaleZ"/>
   · Delete the shape or close without saving (we ONLY need the values)
